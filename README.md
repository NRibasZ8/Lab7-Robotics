Robotics and Python assignment Dijkstra 

This GitHub Repository includes the code that is used in both Thonny IDE (flashed to the ESP32) and on Webots. 
Both codes depend on eachother, as one code will be ran by the ESP which controls the actions of the other code. 

The nodes used by the robot to set the start and end goal, are mapped in this graphic
